# Morvo AI Marketing Platform - Environment Variables Template
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual values.
# For a deployed application, these variables should be set in your hosting environment.
# WARNING: Never commit your actual .env or .env.local file with real secrets to version control.

# --- Morvo Backend API Configuration ---
# This is the URL for your Morvo backend.
# For production, this should point to your deployed Railway app.
VITE_MORVO_API_URL="https://morvo-production.up.railway.app"
VITE_MORVO_WS_URL="wss://morvo-production.up.railway.app/ws"

# --- Supabase Client Configuration ---
# These are needed for the frontend to interact with Supabase (e.g., for authentication).
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-url.supabase.co" # Replace with your actual Supabase project URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-public-anon-key" # Replace with your actual Supabase public anonymous key
# VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF="your-project-ref" # Optional: if needed by your application logic

# --- Other API Keys (Handle with Care) ---
# VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY: Generally, OpenAI API calls should be made from your backend, not directly from the frontend.
# If your build process requires this variable (as suggested by previous logs), provide a placeholder. Otherwise, it can often be removed.
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-if-strictly-needed-by-build"

# VITE_API_KEY & VITE_API_KEY_HEADER: If your Morvo backend (VITE_MORVO_API_URL) requires an additional API key for frontend access,
# (separate from user authentication), configure it here.
# VITE_API_KEY="your-morvo-backend-api-key"
# VITE_API_KEY_HEADER="X-Custom-API-Key"

# --- Application Feature Flags & UI Configuration (Examples - uncomment and adjust as needed) ---
# VITE_MCP_ENABLED="true"
# VITE_MCP_MEMORY_TABLE="agent_memories"
# VITE_MCP_CONTEXT_TABLE="cross_agent_context"
# VITE_MCP_MAX_MEMORIES_PER_AGENT="50"

# VITE_M1_AGENT_ID="m1"
# VITE_M2_AGENT_ID="m2"
# VITE_M3_AGENT_ID="m3"
# VITE_M4_AGENT_ID="m4"
# VITE_M5_AGENT_ID="m5"

# VITE_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE="ar"
# VITE_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES="ar,en"

# --- Development Specific (Usually not in .env.example with production values) ---
# These are typically for your local Vite development server.
# VITE_PORT="8080"
# VITE_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CRITICAL SECURITY NOTE:
# The following variables should NEVER be in your frontend's .env file or .env.example,
# nor should they be directly bundled into your client-side code:
# - VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (this is a backend-only secret)
# - VITE_SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN (user access tokens are dynamic, obtained after login via Supabase client)
# Their presence in previous logs (e.g., \"VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY missing\")
# might indicate a misconfiguration if they were intended for direct frontend use.
# Secure operations requiring such keys must be routed through your backend.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Instructions for local development:
# 1. Copy this updated .env.example file to a new file named .env (or .env.local).
# 2. In your .env (or .env.local) file, fill in your actual:
#    - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
#    - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
#    - VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY (if your build needs it, otherwise it can be blank or the line removed if not used)
#    - Any other custom VITE_API_KEY if your backend requires it.
# 3. Ensure your .env or .env.local file is listed in .gitignore (it usually is by default).
# 4. Restart your frontend development server to apply the changes.
#
# For deployment (e.g., on Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages):
# Set these environment variables (VITE_MORVO_API_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, etc.)
# directly in your hosting provider's environment variable settings. Do NOT deploy your .env file with secrets.
